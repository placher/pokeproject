Much of the last two weeks was spent familiarizing myself with SDL, especially through Lazy Foo tutorials. Our original plan was to develop
our project as a Windows application, but serious problems interfacing with Visual Studio led us to re-orient to a Linux-hosted project. Through
Lazy Foo tutorials, I was able to load backgrounds from art files we developed, as well as load our sprites and move them around the screen,
which were the two primary goals of this sub task. With these two skills acquired, much of the remaining project will be focused on developing
back-end interface for the game (fights, data control, etc.). The sdlimage.cpp file shows how a background can be loaded and displayed using SDL,
and the motion.cpp file shows loading one of our sprites and moving it around the screen.

These test files show that the goals laid out in the pre-break rubric have been accomplished, and serve to move the basic idea of much of the
graphics-side of our project forward. Our discussions also resulted in the development of a preliminary .h file for character control, which
will store the various pokemon implemented into the game.

Complilation of files over ssh results in an error at runtime saying that SDL can't find the renderer. The professor suggested this morning that
there is probably an issue with X-forwarding latency. Finding a fix for this would be great, as the prospect of coding our entire project in the
Cushing lab is less than ideal.
